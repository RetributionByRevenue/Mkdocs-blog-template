## My Blogging Philosophy

1.  **Community Engagement**: Finding people with similar interests online is easy nowadays. While community engagement can be challenging, it can also be enriching to share projects, ideas and thoughts.

2.  **Learning**: Learning is bilateral. Not only the reader will learn something from the blog post, also the author has to achieve profound knowledge of the written material.

3.  **Sharing is Caring**: So many great articles, blogs, docs and books out there that I read and absorbed. Thanks to everyone who is sharing their knowledge. This blog is about giving back my learnings.

4.  **Efficiency**: Keep everything compact and concise :rocket:
